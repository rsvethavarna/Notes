# Math & Notation Foundations — PERFECT EXAM NOTES


## 1. Number System & Sets

### Definitions

* **Natural numbers (ℕ)**: {1, 2, 3, …}
* **Integers (ℤ)**: {…, −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, …}
* **Rational numbers (ℚ)**: Numbers expressible as p/q, q ≠ 0
* **Irrational numbers**: Not expressible as p/q (√2, π)
* **Real numbers (ℝ)**: ℚ ∪ irrational numbers

### Set Notation (write symbols clearly)

* ∈ belongs to | ∉ does not belong to
* ⊂ subset | ∪ union | ∩ intersection
* ∅ empty set

**Exam tip**: Write the set symbol once, then explain in words.

---

## 2. Logic & Mathematical Statements

* A **statement** is either true or false.
* ¬P (NOT P), P ∧ Q (AND), P ∨ Q (OR)
* P → Q (if P then Q), P ↔ Q (if and only if)

**Use**: assumptions, proofs, economic reasoning.

---

## 3. Variables, Constants & Equations

* **Variable**: quantity that can change (x, y, t)
* **Constant**: fixed quantity (a, b, π)

### Equation vs Identity

* **Equation**: true for specific values (x + 2 = 5)
* **Identity**: true for all values ((x + 1)² = x² + 2x + 1)

---

## 4. Functions (Very Important)

### Definition

A **function** assigns exactly one output to each input.

### Notation

* y = f(x)
* Example: f(x) = x² + 3x

### Domain & Range

* **Domain**: permissible input values
* **Range**: corresponding output values

**Example**: f(x) = √x → Domain: x ≥ 0

---

## 5. Graphs & Coordinate Geometry

* x-axis (horizontal), y-axis (vertical)
* Point: (x, y)

### Intercepts

* x-intercept: y = 0
* y-intercept: x = 0

**Applications**: demand–supply curves, cost curves, growth paths.

---

## 6. Exponents & Logarithms

### Exponent Rules

* xᵃ · xᵇ = xᵃ⁺ᵇ
* (xᵃ)ᵇ = xᵃᵇ
* x⁻¹ = 1/x

### Logarithms

* logₐx = y ⇔ aʸ = x
* **ln x**: natural logarithm (base e ≈ 2.718)

**Uses**: growth rates, elasticity, index numbers, econometrics.

---

## 7. Summation Notation (Σ)

### Definition

Σ denotes the sum of a sequence of terms.

### Form

Σᵢ₌₁ⁿ xᵢ = x₁ + x₂ + … + xₙ

### Mean

* Arithmetic Mean = Σxᵢ / n

**Uses**: national income, total cost, expected value.

---

## 8. Calculus Essentials

### Limits

Indicates the value a function approaches as x approaches a point.

Notation: limₓ→a f(x)

### Derivatives

Derivative = **rate of change**.

Notation:

* dy/dx, f′(x)

Example:
If y = x² → dy/dx = 2x

**Economic meaning**: marginal cost, marginal utility, marginal product.

### Integrals

Integral = **area under the curve**.

Notation:

* ∫ f(x) dx

**Uses**: total output, consumer/producer surplus.

---

## 9. Vectors & Matrices (Introductory)

### Vector

* Ordered list of numbers: x = (x₁, x₂)

### Matrix

* Rectangular array of numbers

**Uses**: econometrics, linear models, optimization, AI.

## 10. Key Mathematical Symbols (Memorize)

| Symbol | Meaning                    |
| ------ | -------------------------- |
| Δ      | change                     |
| ∂      | partial change             |
| ∞      | infinity                   |
| ∝      | proportional to            |
| ⇒      | implies                    |
| ≤ ≥    | less/greater than or equal |

**Example**:
∂Y/∂L > 0 → Output increases with labor.

## 13. Examiner Keywords (WRITE THESE WORDS)

Examiners award marks when they see these words:

* "defined as"
* "implies that"
* "mathematically represented as"
* "economically interpreted as"
* "therefore"

👉 Even correct math without these words may lose marks.

---

## 14. Standard Answer Templates (Use Blindly)

> Given: ___
> Required: ___
> Formula used: ___
> Solution: ___
> Hence, ___

### (C) Theory + Math Question (5 marks)

> Definition → Formula → Diagram/Example → Interpretation → Conclusion

If y = 3x²
Dy/dx = 6x
At x = 2 → marginal value = 12

# ⚡ ULTRA-TOPPER MODE (RANKER ENERGY)


## 21. Ranker-Level Definitions (Write Like This)

### Function (Perfect Definition)

A function is a rule that assigns **exactly one output** to each element of the domain. It is denoted as f : X → Y, where X is the domain and Y is the codomain.

### Derivative (Perfect Definition)

The derivative of a function represents the **instantaneous rate of change** of the dependent variable with respect to the independent variable.

### Integral (Perfect Definition)

An integral represents the **accumulated total effect** or **area under a curve** over a given interval.

## 22. Symbol-to-Meaning Conversion (Examiners Love This)

| Symbol | Ranker Interpretation            |

| Σ      | aggregation of individual values |
| ∫      | total accumulation               |
