## 1. Numbers & Sets

### 1.1 Types of Numbers

* **Natural numbers (ℕ)**: {1, 2, 3, …}
* **Whole numbers**: {0, 1, 2, 3, …}
* **Integers (ℤ)**: {…, −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, …}
* **Rational numbers (ℚ)**: Numbers that can be written as a fraction (e.g., 3/4, −5)
* **Irrational numbers**: Cannot be written as a fraction (e.g., √2, π)
* **Real numbers (ℝ)**: All rational + irrational numbers

### 1.2 Sets

* A **set** is a collection of elements.
* Example: A = {1, 3, 5}

Common symbols:

* ∈ : “belongs to” (3 ∈ A)
* ∉ : “does not belong to”
* ⊂ : subset
* ∅ : empty set

---

## 2. Logic & Statements

### 2.1 Logical Statements

A statement is something that is either **true or false**.

Examples:

* “2 + 2 = 4” (True)
* “Inflation is always bad” (False / debatable → not a strict logical statement)

### 2.2 Logical Symbols

* ¬P : NOT P
* P ∧ Q : P AND Q
* P ∨ Q : P OR Q
* P → Q : If P, then Q
* P ↔ Q : P if and only if Q

Used heavily in **proofs, economics assumptions, and algorithms**.

## 3. Algebra Basics

### 3.1 Variables & Constants

* **Variable**: A symbol whose value can change (x, y, t)
* **Constant**: A fixed value (5, π, e)

Example:

> y = 2x + 3

Here:

* x → independent variable
* y → dependent variable

### 3.2 Equations vs Identities

* **Equation**: True only for certain values (x + 2 = 5)
* **Identity**: True for all values ((x + 1)² = x² + 2x + 1)

---

## 4. Functions

### 4.1 What is a Function?

A **function** maps each input to exactly one output.

Notation:

* f(x) = x²
* y = f(x)

Meaning:

> For every x, the function gives one value of y

### 4.2 Domain & Range

* **Domain**: All possible input values
* **Range**: All possible output values

Example:

* f(x) = √x
* Domain: x ≥ 0

Used in:

* Cost curves
* Demand & supply
* Growth trends

---

## 6. Exponents & Logarithms

### 6.1 Exponents

* x² = x × x
* x⁰ = 1
* x⁻¹ = 1/x

Rules:

* xᵃ · xᵇ = xᵃ⁺ᵇ
* (xᵃ)ᵇ = xᵃᵇ

### 6.2 Logarithms

Logarithms are the **inverse of exponents**.

* logₐ(x) = y ⇔ aʸ = x

Common logs:

* log (base 10)
* ln (natural log, base e ≈ 2.718)

Used in:

* Growth rates
* Elasticity
* Econometrics

---

## 7. Summation & Series

### 7.1 Summation Notation (Σ)

Σ means **add up terms**.

Example:
Σᵢ₌₁ⁿ xᵢ = x₁ + x₂ + … + xₙ

Used in:

* Total cost
* National income
* Expected value

### 7.2 Averages

* Mean: (Σxᵢ) / n

---

## 8. Basic Calculus Concepts

### 8.1 Limits (Idea Only)

A limit looks at what happens to a function **as x approaches a value**.

Notation:
limₓ→a f(x)

### 8.2 Derivatives

Derivative = **rate of change**.

Notation:

* f′(x)
* dy/dx

Example:
If y = x²,
then dy/dx = 2x

Used in:

* Marginal cost
* Marginal utility
* Optimization

### 8.3 Integrals

Integral = **area under a curve**.

Notation:
∫ f(x) dx

Used in:

* Total output
* Consumer surplus

---

## 9. Vectors & Matrices (Intro)

### 9.1 Vectors

A vector is an ordered list of numbers.

x = [x₁, x₂, x₃]

### 9.2 Matrices

A matrix is a table of numbers.

A = [ [1  2]
[3  4] ]

Used in:

* Econometrics
* Machine learning
* Optimization
